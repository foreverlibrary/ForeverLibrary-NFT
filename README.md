# ForeverLibrary-NFT

Forever Library is a shared public good for all artists to mint and preserve their music onchain.

It is simply meant to be an open NFT minting contract, which anyone can utilize regardless of liveness of a particular front end.

The primary tenets of this contract include:
Non-Upgradeable - it is meant to serve as steady and long-term bedrock for minting front-ends, marketplaces, and indexers to utilize and build upon.
Publicly mintable - all can utilize this contract openly.
Immutable metadata - tokens are meant to be a permanent statement. Future edits should be done with newly minted tokens, burning previous immutable tokens.

All feedback and suggestions are welcome and encouraged!
